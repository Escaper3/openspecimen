Welcome to the catissue-core repository!
=====================================

caTissue Suite offers a modular, open-source specimen inventory and tracking system that will encompass a 
core database module for those Centers in need of new solutions, as well as application programming interfaces (APIs), 
software development toolkits (SDKs), and additional annotation modules for those centers with legacy systems that 
wish to link into the virtual tissue repositories and query across Cancer Centers. 

The catissue-core repository contains the code for the core of the caTissue Suite application. Please note that this repository does not represent the caTissue Core application - an earlier version of caTissue.
